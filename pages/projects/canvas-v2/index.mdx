I started this project not very long ago after helping my mom, who is a teacher, try to set up her Canvas classes for her students. Neither of us could figure out how to do anything we wanted to and it was a pain to configure the classes. We found it to be very unintuative and there were so many features it was hard to decide what to use. Canvas is also slow in general and has a clunky UI. Because of these reasons I decided to start making a cloud-based alternative to Canvas. Yes I know the name is not unique at all, but it is temporary until I think of something better.
